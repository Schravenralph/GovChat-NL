# US006A: Natural Language Policy Search

## User Story

**As a** policy researcher
**I need** to search for policies using natural language questions
**So that** I can find relevant documents without knowing exact keywords

## Description

The system should leverage AI to understand natural language queries and return semantically relevant policy documents. This allows users to ask questions in plain language and receive intelligent results based on meaning rather than just keyword matching.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Perform natural language query

**Given** I want to find policies about a specific topic
**When** I enter a natural language question like "What are the rules about parking in residential areas?"
**Then** the system should return relevant policy documents about parking regulations
**And** the results should be ranked by semantic relevance
**And** I should see an explanation of why each document is relevant

### Scenario 2: Handle complex questions

**Given** I ask a multi-part question
**When** I enter a query like "What are the noise restrictions for construction near schools during weekdays?"
**Then** the system should identify all key concepts (noise, construction, schools, weekdays)
**And** return documents that address these combined criteria
**And** highlight which parts of my query each document addresses

### Scenario 3: Understand query intent

**Given** I enter a vague or broad question
**When** the system analyzes my query
**Then** it should suggest refinements or related topics
**And** show me the most relevant results based on common interpretations
**And** allow me to adjust the query based on suggestions

### Scenario 4: Multi-language query support

**Given** policy documents exist in both Dutch and English
**When** I perform a search in Dutch
**Then** the system should return relevant results in both languages
**And** maintain semantic accuracy across languages
**And** provide translations for result snippets when needed
