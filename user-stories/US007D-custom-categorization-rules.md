# US007D: Create Custom Categorization Rules

## User Story

**As a** system administrator
**I need** to create and manage custom categorization rules
**So that** documents are automatically classified according to organizational needs

## Description

Administrators should be able to define custom rules that automatically assign categories and tags to documents based on specific criteria. This enables organizations to tailor the categorization system to their specific domain and requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Create a categorization rule

**Given** I am an administrator configuring the categorization system
**When** I create a custom categorization rule
**Then** I should be able to define:
- Rule name and description
- Keywords or patterns that trigger the category
- Priority level for the rule
- Whether to auto-apply or suggest the category
- Which category/tags to assign when triggered
**And** the rule should be validated before saving

### Scenario 2: Test categorization rules

**Given** I have created a new categorization rule
**When** I test the rule
**Then** the system should show me a sample of documents that would match
**And** display what categories/tags would be assigned
**And** allow me to refine the rule based on results
**And** show the estimated impact (number of documents affected)

### Scenario 3: Manage rule priority

**Given** multiple rules might apply to the same document
**When** I configure rule priorities
**Then** higher-priority rules should be evaluated first
**And** I should be able to set whether lower-priority rules can add additional tags
**And** I should be able to reorder rules by dragging and dropping

### Scenario 4: Apply rules retroactively

**Given** I have created a new rule for existing documents
**When** I choose to apply the rule retroactively
**Then** I should see a preview of documents that will be affected
**And** be able to confirm or cancel the bulk application
**And** receive a summary of how many documents were recategorized

### Scenario 5: Rule-based tag blacklist

**Given** certain tags are incorrectly applied by automatic systems
**When** I create a blacklist rule
**Then** I should be able to specify tags that should never be auto-applied
**And** specify conditions for when the blacklist applies
**And** existing incorrect tags should be flagged for review

### Scenario 6: View rule application history

**Given** I want to understand how rules are performing
**When** I view rule analytics
**Then** I should see:
- How many documents each rule has categorized
- Success rate (how often manual review confirms the categorization)
- Most recently applied rules
- Rules that frequently trigger together
**And** I should be able to export rule performance data
