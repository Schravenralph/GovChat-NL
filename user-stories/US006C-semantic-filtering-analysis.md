# US006C: Concept-Based Filtering and Policy Evolution

## User Story

**As a** policy researcher
**I need** to filter by semantic concepts and track policy changes over time
**So that** I can find thematically related policies and understand how regulations evolve

## Description

The system should enable filtering by abstract concepts rather than just keywords, and use AI to track how policies change over time. This allows for more sophisticated research into policy themes and historical development.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Filter by semantic concepts

**Given** I want to filter by policy concepts rather than keywords
**When** I select semantic concepts (e.g., "sustainability", "public safety", "economic development")
**Then** the system should filter documents by semantic meaning
**And** show documents that relate to the concept even without exact terms
**And** allow me to combine multiple concepts with AND/OR logic

### Scenario 2: Browse concept taxonomy

**Given** I want to explore available semantic concepts
**When** I access the concept browser
**Then** I should see a hierarchical view of policy concepts
**And** each concept should show the number of related documents
**And** I should be able to select concepts at different levels of specificity

### Scenario 3: Detect policy changes over time

**Given** I want to understand how a policy has evolved
**When** I view the change history for a policy topic
**Then** the AI should identify and summarize key changes
**And** show timeline of policy updates across different versions
**And** highlight significant modifications to regulations
**And** explain the impact of changes in plain language

### Scenario 4: Cross-reference related policies

**Given** I am researching a topic that spans multiple policy domains
**When** I search for a topic using semantic search
**Then** the system should identify relevant policies across different sources
**And** show connections between related policies
**And** highlight potential conflicts or contradictions
**And** provide a unified view of all relevant regulations

### Scenario 5: Track policy impact across municipalities

**Given** I want to see how similar policies are implemented differently
**When** I search for a policy concept
**Then** the system should show variations across municipalities
**And** highlight regional differences in policy approach
**And** allow me to compare implementation across locations
