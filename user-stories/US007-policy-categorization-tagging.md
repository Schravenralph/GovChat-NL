# US007: Automated Policy Categorization and Tagging

## User Story

**As a** policy researcher
**I need** policies to be automatically categorized and tagged
**So that** I can quickly navigate and organize large collections of policy documents

## Description

The system should automatically analyze and categorize scanned policy documents using AI and predefined taxonomies. Documents should be tagged with relevant categories, topics, and metadata to enable better organization, filtering, and discovery.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Automatically categorize new documents

**Given** a new policy document has been scanned and indexed
**When** the document is processed
**Then** the system should automatically assign primary and secondary categories
**And** categories should be based on a predefined taxonomy (e.g., "Finance", "Healthcare", "Infrastructure")
**And** the confidence level for each category should be displayed
**And** I should be able to review and override automatic categorizations

### Scenario 2: Generate automatic tags

**Given** a policy document has been scanned
**When** the AI processes the document content
**Then** relevant tags should be automatically generated (e.g., "parking", "zoning", "permits")
**And** tags should be extracted from both the document title and content
**And** the most relevant tags should be prioritized
**And** I should see a maximum of 10 tags per document

### Scenario 3: Manual tag management

**Given** I am viewing a policy document
**When** I want to add or modify tags
**Then** I should be able to add custom tags manually
**And** I should be able to remove auto-generated tags
**And** the system should suggest tags based on similar documents
**And** tags should be saved and immediately searchable

### Scenario 4: Browse by category

**Given** I want to explore policies by category
**When** I navigate to the category browser
**Then** I should see a hierarchical view of all categories
**And** each category should show the number of documents it contains
**And** I should be able to expand subcategories
**And** clicking a category should filter results to show only those documents

### Scenario 5: Create custom categorization rules

**Given** I am an administrator configuring the categorization system
**When** I create a custom categorization rule
**Then** I should be able to define:
- Rule name and description
- Keywords or patterns that trigger the category
- Priority level for the rule
- Whether to auto-apply or suggest the category
**And** the rule should be applied to future documents
**And** I should be able to retroactively apply it to existing documents

### Scenario 6: Tag-based filtering

**Given** I am searching for policy documents
**When** I filter by specific tags
**Then** only documents with those tags should be displayed
**And** I should be able to combine multiple tags (AND/OR logic)
**And** I should see tag suggestions based on current search results
**And** the result count should update as I add or remove tags

### Scenario 7: View category statistics

**Given** I want to understand the policy document collection
**When** I view category statistics
**Then** I should see:
- Number of documents per category
- Most common tags across all documents
- Category distribution over time
- Growth trends for specific categories
**And** I should be able to export statistics as charts or reports

### Scenario 8: Multi-label classification

**Given** a policy document covers multiple topics
**When** the system categorizes the document
**Then** it should assign multiple relevant categories
**And** each category should have a confidence score
**And** the primary category should be clearly indicated
**And** I should be able to see all assigned categories in the document metadata

### Scenario 9: Category hierarchy navigation

**Given** categories are organized in a hierarchy (parent-child relationships)
**When** I select a parent category
**Then** I should see options to include or exclude subcategories
**And** breadcrumb navigation should show the current category path
**And** I should be able to quickly jump to parent or sibling categories
