# US006B: AI-Powered Document Analysis and Summaries

## User Story

**As a** policy researcher
**I need** AI to analyze and summarize policy documents
**So that** I can quickly understand document content without reading everything in detail

## Description

The system should use AI to analyze policy documents and generate summaries, answer questions about specific documents, and identify similar policies. This helps users quickly assess document relevance and understand complex policy content.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Generate AI document summaries

**Given** I have search results with multiple long policy documents
**When** I request an AI summary for a document
**Then** the system should generate a concise summary of the policy
**And** highlight key points and main regulations
**And** indicate which sections are most relevant to my search query
**And** provide the summary in my preferred language (Dutch or English)

### Scenario 2: Ask questions about specific policies

**Given** I am viewing a policy document
**When** I ask a specific question about the policy using the AI chat feature
**Then** the AI should analyze the document content
**And** provide an accurate answer based on the policy text
**And** cite the specific sections that support the answer
**And** warn me if the answer is uncertain or requires human verification

### Scenario 3: Find semantically similar policies

**Given** I am viewing a specific policy document
**When** I click "Find Similar Policies"
**Then** the system should use AI to identify semantically similar documents
**And** show policies with related content from different sources
**And** highlight the similarities between documents
**And** rank results by degree of similarity

### Scenario 4: Compare policies side-by-side

**Given** I have identified similar policies
**When** I select multiple policies to compare
**Then** the system should display them side-by-side
**And** highlight key differences and similarities
**And** allow me to navigate to specific sections
**And** provide an AI-generated comparison summary
