# US004C: Track Document Access History

## User Story

**As a** policy researcher
**I need** to track my document viewing and download history
**So that** I can easily return to previously accessed documents and maintain a record of my research

## Description

The system should automatically record when users view or download policy documents. This history should be accessible to users, allowing them to quickly return to documents they've previously accessed.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Automatically track document views

**Given** I am logged in as a user
**When** I view a document
**Then** the system should record this action with a timestamp
**And** the document should appear in my "Recently Viewed" list
**And** this should happen without any manual action from me

### Scenario 2: View recently accessed documents

**Given** I have viewed multiple documents
**When** I navigate to "Recently Viewed Documents"
**Then** I should see a chronological list of documents I've viewed
**And** each entry should show the document title, source, and view date
**And** I should be able to click on any entry to view the document again

### Scenario 3: Track document downloads

**Given** I download a document
**When** the download completes successfully
**Then** the system should record the download with a timestamp
**And** the document should appear in my "Download History"
**And** I should see the download date and file name

### Scenario 4: Access download history

**Given** I have downloaded documents previously
**When** I navigate to my "Download History"
**Then** I should see all documents I've downloaded
**And** I should be able to re-download any document from the history
**And** I should be able to filter by date range or document type

### Scenario 5: Clear viewing history

**Given** I want to clear my viewing history
**When** I select "Clear History" and confirm
**Then** my recently viewed documents list should be emptied
**And** I should see a confirmation message
**And** my download history should remain intact unless also cleared

### Scenario 6: Set history retention preferences

**Given** I am managing my account settings
**When** I configure history retention settings
**Then** I should be able to set how long history is retained (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, forever)
**And** I should be able to enable/disable automatic history tracking
**And** old history beyond the retention period should be automatically deleted
