# US006: AI-Powered Semantic Search for Policies

## User Story

**As a** policy researcher
**I need** to perform AI-powered semantic searches across policy documents
**So that** I can find relevant policies based on meaning and context, not just keywords

## Description

The system should leverage AI and natural language processing to understand the semantic meaning of search queries and policy documents. This allows users to find relevant policies even when they don't contain exact keyword matches, by understanding the intent and context of the search.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Perform natural language query

**Given** I want to find policies about a specific topic
**When** I enter a natural language question like "What are the rules about parking in residential areas?"
**Then** the system should return relevant policy documents about parking regulations
**And** the results should be ranked by semantic relevance
**And** I should see an explanation of why each document is relevant

### Scenario 2: Find similar policies

**Given** I am viewing a specific policy document
**When** I click "Find Similar Policies"
**Then** the system should use AI to identify semantically similar documents
**And** show policies with related content from different sources
**And** highlight the similarities between documents
**And** allow me to compare similar policies side-by-side

### Scenario 3: Get AI-generated summaries

**Given** I have search results with multiple long policy documents
**When** I request an AI summary for a document
**Then** the system should generate a concise summary of the policy
**And** highlight key points and main regulations
**And** indicate which sections are most relevant to my search query
**And** provide the summary in my preferred language (Dutch or English)

### Scenario 4: Ask questions about policies

**Given** I am viewing a policy document
**When** I ask a specific question about the policy using the AI chat feature
**Then** the AI should analyze the document content
**And** provide an accurate answer based on the policy text
**And** cite the specific sections that support the answer
**And** warn me if the answer is uncertain or requires human verification

### Scenario 5: Cross-reference policies

**Given** I am researching a topic that spans multiple policy domains
**When** I search for a topic using semantic search
**Then** the system should identify relevant policies across different sources
**And** show connections between related policies
**And** highlight potential conflicts or contradictions
**And** provide a unified view of all relevant regulations

### Scenario 6: Concept-based filtering

**Given** I want to filter by policy concepts rather than keywords
**When** I select semantic concepts (e.g., "sustainability", "public safety", "economic development")
**Then** the system should filter documents by semantic meaning
**And** show documents that relate to the concept even without exact terms
**And** allow me to combine multiple concepts with AND/OR logic

### Scenario 7: Detect policy changes over time

**Given** I want to understand how a policy has evolved
**When** I view the change history for a policy topic
**Then** the AI should identify and summarize key changes
**And** show timeline of policy updates across different versions
**And** highlight significant modifications to regulations
**And** explain the impact of changes in plain language

### Scenario 8: Multi-language semantic search

**Given** policy documents exist in both Dutch and English
**When** I perform a search in Dutch
**Then** the system should return relevant results in both languages
**And** provide translations for documents in the other language
**And** maintain semantic accuracy across languages
**And** allow me to specify language preferences for results
