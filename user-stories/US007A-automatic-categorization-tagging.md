# US007A: Automatic Policy Categorization and Tagging

## User Story

**As a** policy researcher
**I need** policies to be automatically categorized and tagged by AI
**So that** documents are organized consistently without manual effort

## Description

The system should automatically analyze scanned policy documents and assign appropriate categories and tags using AI. This ensures consistent organization across large document collections and reduces the need for manual classification.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Automatically categorize new documents

**Given** a new policy document has been scanned and indexed
**When** the document is processed
**Then** the system should automatically assign primary and secondary categories
**And** categories should be based on a predefined taxonomy (e.g., "Finance", "Healthcare", "Infrastructure")
**And** the confidence level for each category should be displayed
**And** I should be able to review and override automatic categorizations

### Scenario 2: Generate automatic tags

**Given** a policy document has been scanned
**When** the AI processes the document content
**Then** relevant tags should be automatically generated (e.g., "parking", "zoning", "permits")
**And** tags should be extracted from both the document title and content
**And** the most relevant tags should be prioritized
**And** I should see a maximum of 10 tags per document

### Scenario 3: Multi-label classification

**Given** a policy document covers multiple topics
**When** the system categorizes the document
**Then** it should assign multiple relevant categories
**And** each category should have a confidence score
**And** the primary category should be clearly indicated
**And** I should be able to see all assigned categories in the document metadata

### Scenario 4: View categorization confidence

**Given** I am reviewing automatically categorized documents
**When** I view the category assignments
**Then** I should see a confidence score for each category (0-100%)
**And** low-confidence assignments should be highlighted for review
**And** I should be able to sort documents by confidence level
