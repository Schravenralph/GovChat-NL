# US005C: Handle Scan Failures and Send Notifications

## User Story

**As a** system administrator
**I need** to be notified of scan failures and have automatic retry mechanisms
**So that** scanning issues are resolved quickly and I'm informed of persistent problems

## Description

The system should automatically handle scan failures with retry logic and notify administrators when issues require attention. This ensures that temporary problems don't result in missed updates while persistent issues are escalated appropriately.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Automatic retry on scan failure

**Given** a scheduled scan has failed due to a temporary error
**When** the system detects the failure
**Then** it should automatically retry the scan (up to 3 attempts)
**And** wait progressively longer between retries (5 min, 15 min, 30 min)
**And** log each retry attempt with timestamp and reason

### Scenario 2: Notify on persistent failures

**Given** a scan has failed after all retry attempts
**When** all retry attempts have been exhausted
**Then** I should receive a notification about the failure
**And** the notification should include the source name and error details
**And** the scan should be marked as "failed" in the history

### Scenario 3: Configure notification preferences

**Given** I am an administrator setting up notifications
**When** I configure notification settings
**Then** I should be able to choose notification channels:
- Email
- In-app notification
- Webhook (optional)
**And** I should be able to configure which events trigger notifications
**And** I should be able to set notification recipients by role or user

### Scenario 4: Receive scan success notifications

**Given** I have enabled success notifications
**When** a scan completes successfully
**Then** I should receive a notification
**And** the notification should include:
- Source name
- Scan completion time
- Number of new documents found
- Number of updated documents

### Scenario 5: Notification digest mode

**Given** I don't want to receive individual notifications for each scan
**When** I configure digest mode
**Then** I should receive a single summary notification at a scheduled time
**And** the digest should include all scan activity since the last digest
**And** I should be able to set digest frequency (daily, weekly)

### Scenario 6: Handle specific error types

**Given** different types of scan errors can occur
**When** a scan fails
**Then** the system should categorize the error (network, authentication, parsing, etc.)
**And** apply appropriate retry logic based on error type
**And** some errors (e.g., authentication) should notify immediately without retries
**And** transient errors (e.g., network timeout) should retry automatically
