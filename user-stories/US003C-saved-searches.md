# US003C: Save and Manage Search Queries

## User Story

**As a** policy researcher
**I need** to save my search queries and filters
**So that** I can quickly re-run frequent searches and receive notifications about new matching documents

## Description

Users should be able to save complex search queries with their applied filters for later use. This enables recurring searches to be executed quickly and allows users to be notified when new documents match their saved criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Save a search query

**Given** I have performed a search with multiple filters applied
**When** I click "Save Search"
**Then** I should be prompted to enter a name for the saved search
**And** the search should be saved with all current filters and keywords
**And** I should see a confirmation message

### Scenario 2: Access saved searches

**Given** I have saved one or more searches
**When** I navigate to the "Saved Searches" menu
**Then** I should see a list of all my saved searches
**And** each entry should show the search name and creation date
**And** I should be able to click on a saved search to execute it

### Scenario 3: Execute a saved search

**Given** I am viewing my saved searches
**When** I click on a saved search name
**Then** the search should execute with the saved filters and keywords
**And** the results should display as if I had manually entered the criteria
**And** I should be able to modify the filters before executing

### Scenario 4: Enable notifications for saved search

**Given** I have a saved search
**When** I enable notifications for that search
**Then** I should receive a notification when new documents match the criteria
**And** I should be able to configure notification frequency (immediate, daily digest, weekly digest)
**And** notifications should include the number of new matching documents

### Scenario 5: Delete a saved search

**Given** I have a saved search that is no longer needed
**When** I click "Delete" on the saved search
**Then** I should be prompted to confirm the deletion
**And** after confirming, the saved search should be removed
**And** any associated notifications should be disabled

### Scenario 6: Rename a saved search

**Given** I want to update the name of a saved search
**When** I select "Rename" on a saved search
**Then** I should be able to enter a new name
**And** the search should be saved with the new name
**And** all other settings should remain unchanged
