# US007C: Browse and Filter by Categories and Tags

## User Story

**As a** policy researcher
**I need** to browse and filter documents using categories and tags
**So that** I can explore the document collection and find related policies

## Description

Users should be able to navigate the policy document collection using categories and tags. This provides an alternative discovery method to search and enables users to explore thematically related documents.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Browse by category hierarchy

**Given** I want to explore policies by category
**When** I navigate to the category browser
**Then** I should see a hierarchical view of all categories
**And** each category should show the number of documents it contains
**And** I should be able to expand subcategories
**And** clicking a category should filter results to show only those documents

### Scenario 2: Filter search results by tags

**Given** I am searching for policy documents
**When** I filter by specific tags
**Then** only documents with those tags should be displayed
**And** I should be able to combine multiple tags (AND/OR logic)
**And** I should see tag suggestions based on current search results
**And** the result count should update as I add or remove tags

### Scenario 3: Category hierarchy navigation

**Given** categories are organized in a hierarchy (parent-child relationships)
**When** I select a parent category
**Then** I should see options to include or exclude subcategories
**And** breadcrumb navigation should show the current category path
**And** I should be able to quickly jump to parent or sibling categories

### Scenario 4: View related tags and categories

**Given** I am viewing documents with a specific tag
**When** I look at the tag details
**Then** I should see other frequently co-occurring tags
**And** see categories that commonly include this tag
**And** be able to click on related tags to refine my filter

### Scenario 5: Tag cloud visualization

**Given** I want a visual overview of document topics
**When** I view the tag cloud
**Then** tags should be sized based on usage frequency
**And** clicking a tag should filter documents by that tag
**And** I should be able to toggle between tag cloud and list view

### Scenario 6: View category statistics

**Given** I want to understand the policy document collection
**When** I view category statistics
**Then** I should see:

- Growth trends for specific categories over time
- Most common tags within each category
**And** I should be able to export statistics as charts or reports
